# : represent important thing or file name

composition: Generally, this approach of building a user interface from smaller building blocks.

# Card.js
From Card.js, we learn the concept of Composition, where we are using props.children to render the other components
# props.children: It is reserve keyword from React
props.className: Whatever we pass from ExpenseItem to where we render same will be card.js to render
<card className="ExpenseItem">Inside Content</card>

You can think that data and className coming from ExpenseItem.js and passing to card.js for rendering.


- In React, We build user interface by building and combining components.

# Why is React all about "Components"?

Every UI in the end up is made up of multiple building blocks (= components), hence it makes sense to think about user interfaces as "combinations of components"
