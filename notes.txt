# : represent important thing or file name
- : important line

composition: Generally, this approach of building a user interface from smaller building blocks.

# Card.js
From Card.js, we learn the concept of Composition, where we are using props.children to render the other components
# props.children: It is reserve keyword from React
props.className: Whatever we pass from ExpenseItem to where we render same will be card.js to render
<card className="ExpenseItem">Inside Content</card>

You can think that data and className coming from ExpenseItem.js and passing to card.js for rendering.


- In React, We build user interface by building and combining components.

# Why is React all about "Components"?

Every UI in the end up is made up of multiple building blocks (= components), hence it makes sense to think about user interfaces as "combinations of components"

# Closer look at JSX?
return (
    <div>
      <h2>Let's get started!</h2>
      <Expenses items={expenses} />
    </div>
  );
Before React v18, or earlier version --
It import 'React' in every JSX file then it will be use below function to create element. Above code return  like this.

import React from 'react';
import Expenses from './components/Expenses';

// Object of properties need to be set is 2nd parameter in this list.

return React.createElement(
    'div', {}, 
    React.createElement('h2', {}, 'Lets get started!'),
    React.createElement(Expenses, {items: expenses})
);
